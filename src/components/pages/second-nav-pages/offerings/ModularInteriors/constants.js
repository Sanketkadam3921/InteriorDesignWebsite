      "What makes KalaKruti modular kitchens different from traditional kitchens?",
    answer:
      "Our modular kitchens are precision-engineered with 4-sigma accuracy and come with a flat 10-year warranty.

Each module is designed to fit perfectly and can be easily replaced or modified as your needs change.",

Key factors include kitchen dimensions, choice of shutters (laminates, acrylic, or solid wood), hardware quality, countertop material (granite, quartz, or marble), and additional features like soft-close mechanisms, LED lighting, and smart storage solutions.
