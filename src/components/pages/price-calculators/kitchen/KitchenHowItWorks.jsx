                        The shape of your kitchen (L-shaped, U-shaped, or Straight) helps us understand
                        the layout and workflow. This determines the number of cabinets, countertops,
                        and storage solutions required for your space.

                        Based on the size of your kitchen, our calculator estimates the cost per sq. ft.
                        for the selected materials and services. Accurate measurements ensure precise
                        pricing for both materials and labor, minimizing any unexpected costs.
