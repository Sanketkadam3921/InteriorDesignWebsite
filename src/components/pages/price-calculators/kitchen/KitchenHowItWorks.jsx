                        The shape of your kitchen (L-shaped, U-shaped, or Straight) helps us understand the
                        configuration and workflow. This determines the number of cabinets, countertops, and
                        storage solutions needed for your space.

                        for the interior services. Accurate measurements ensure precise pricing for materials
                        and labor.
